EXAMPLE2: Stochastic growth model
A simple birth process where growth occurs with a per-capita growth rate r/week and the total number of subjects is determined by dN/dt = r N. The exact solution to this equation is that of exponential growth, N(0) Exp(r t).

This is an extension of EXAMPLE1 to introduce the user to multiple simulations in the same run. This allows estimation of statistical functions such as mean and probability of extinction using a single run.
